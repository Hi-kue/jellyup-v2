1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,720
All your buddies for the next 10 years

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,480
are gonna be judging themselves.

3
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:07,200
She and he are gonna be looking around

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,480
and being like, "Where am I? Where am I?"

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,480
You need to be optimistic and patient

6
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:14,000
and everything will work out.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,400
And if you're not, it won't.

8
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,000
The end.

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,400
You're fucking 21. Patience, man, patience.

10
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,700
Everybody's looking up to audit themselves

11
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:23,300
where they are now.

12
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,400
I promise you, show me everybody

13
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,500
you think is fancy at 22.

14
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:30,000
Show me where they were.

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,600
You need to be thoughtful.

16
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,800
But people are dwelling.

17
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,800
And people that dwell and obsess

18
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,400
on where they're at in their 20s, yes.

19
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,000
Just close your eyes

20
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,200
until you're 29.
