1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,200
Behind me is a new Corvette ZR1

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:04,000
and this car is absolutely unhinged.

3
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:06,680
That's because underneath this 63 inspired

4
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:08,480
split window you have a twin turbo

5
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,440
flat plane V8 that makes 1,064 horsepower

6
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,400
and only goes to the rear wheels.

7
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,820
So like I said, unhinged.

8
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:21,140
To keep the engine cool, I get this vent and this new vent.

9
00:00:21,899 --> 00:00:24,920
This third vent is going to cool my standard carbon

10
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:27,160
ceramic brakes and to keep the car glued

11
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,340
to the ground you get these

12
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:29,860
345 Michelin tires.

13
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,500
Instead of a front trunk, you get this

14
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,680
massive new vent that gives you more aero and cooling.

15
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:35,400
But don't worry because

16
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,880
you still get a rear trunk.

17
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:38,600
And Chevy says this has a top speed

18
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,900
well over 215 miles an hour,

19
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,860
which means it's faster than a Porsche

20
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:42,800
918 Spyder.

21
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:45,400
I get a carbon wheel, carbon paddle shifters,

22
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,599
my digital display,

23
00:00:46,599 --> 00:00:47,440
my touchscreen,

24
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:48,520
this giant wall of

25
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:49,960
buttons, wireless charging pad,

26
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:50,960
these super supportive seats,

27
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:51,200
but there's more.

28
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,800
You can get a track package that gives you this gigantic

29
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,660
carbon fiber wing,

30
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:55,520
these carbon fiber canards,

31
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,680
and carbon fiber wheels.

32
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:57,959
You can also get it in a convertible.
