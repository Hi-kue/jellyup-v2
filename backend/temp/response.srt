1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,820
We make chicken wings but we leave out the calories.

2
00:00:00,959 --> 00:00:03,460
Every time I make fried chicken wings

3
00:00:03,819 --> 00:00:05,460
I have to hear wang wang

4
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:06,840
we want healthy

5
00:00:07,099 --> 00:00:07,820
Y'all do be whining

6
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:09,560
Off rip I'm gonna deviate

7
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:10,180
add a little bit of olive oil

8
00:00:10,279 --> 00:00:11,260
because they're gonna air fry right

9
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:12,079
So I

10
00:00:11,659 --> 00:00:12,180
need a little bit of like oil

11
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:14,640
as a conduit right

12
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:15,859
If it comes out fucked up

13
00:00:15,979 --> 00:00:16,420
it's on me right

14
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:17,579
Another one of my brothers who

15
00:00:17,579 --> 00:00:18,600
didn't say anything about measurements

16
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:19,579
so we're gonna measure with our souls

17
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:21,659
Also went in with some pepper

18
00:00:21,879 --> 00:00:22,600
some garlic powder

19
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:23,600
some onion powder

20
00:00:23,719 --> 00:00:24,379
some paprika

21
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:25,680
some cayenne pepper

22
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:26,620
some lemon pepper seasoning

23
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:27,620
This is from my garden

24
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,200
so this is gonna be an extra love here

25
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:31,719
A little bit of that elbow ash for a good measure

26
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:33,880
and some baking powder

27
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:34,860
Give that a toss

28
00:00:34,979 --> 00:00:35,180
I'm gonna

29
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:35,560
put that in a 400 degree air fryer

30
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:38,500
Air fryer 20 minutes

31
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:40,139
Flipping halfway through

32
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:41,020
I let these go for

33
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:41,800
35 minutes

34
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:42,680
They are not crispy

35
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:44,159
Is that my fault

36
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:44,979
for adding the oil

37
00:00:45,639 --> 00:00:46,440
It could be my fault

38
00:00:46,659 --> 00:00:46,979
for adding the oil

39
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:48,740
so let's just judge these off of taste

40
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,380
The flavor's all there

41
00:00:52,139 --> 00:00:52,479
Jeez Louise

42
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:53,939
there's juices in them

43
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:54,779
So

44
00:00:54,779 --> 00:00:55,319
I essentially just made

45
00:00:55,319 --> 00:00:55,799
a roasted chicken wing

46
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:56,860
A very good roasted chicken wing

47
00:00:58,319 --> 00:00:58,740
Don't add any oil
