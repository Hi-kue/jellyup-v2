1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,180
All your buddies for the next 10 years

2
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:03,200
are gonna be judging themselves.

3
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:06,200
She and he are gonna be looking around and being like,

4
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,740
where am I? Where am I?

5
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:09,060
You need to be optimistic

6
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:09,600
and patient

7
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:10,920
and everything will work out.

8
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,040
And if you're not,

9
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:13,240
it won't.

10
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:14,360
The end.

11
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:15,740
You're fucking 21.

12
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:16,760
Patience man,

13
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,104
patience.

14
00:00:18,104 --> 00:00:20,040
Everybody's looking up to audit themselves.

15
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:20,660
Where they are now,

16
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:21,460
I promise you,

17
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:22,180
show me everybody

18
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:23,460
you think is fancy at 22.

19
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:24,440
Show me where they were.

20
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:24,960
You need to be thoughtful.

21
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:25,360
But people are dwelling,

22
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:26,080
and people that dwell

23
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:26,640
and obsess on where they're at.

24
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,560
In their 20s, yes.

25
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,200
Just close your eyes until you're 29.
